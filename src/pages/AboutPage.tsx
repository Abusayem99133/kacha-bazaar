          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Kacha Bazar started with a simple idea: to make fresh, organic produce accessible to everyone. 
            What began as a small farmer's market stall has grown into a thriving online marketplace 
            connecting local farmers directly with consumers who care about quality, sustainability, 
            and supporting local communities.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            At Kacha Bazar, our mission is to revolutionize the way people shop for groceries by 
            providing a seamless online platform that delivers farm-fresh products directly to your doorstep. 
            We believe in:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Offering only the freshest, highest-quality produce</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Supporting eco-friendly farming practices</li>
            <li><strong>Community:</strong> Building relationships between farmers and consumers</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Providing clear information about product origins</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Our Products</h2>
          <p>
            We carefully curate our selection of products, working directly with local farmers and 
            artisanal producers who share our values. From seasonal fruits and vegetables to dairy, 
            meats, and pantry staples, every item in our inventory is selected for its quality, 
            freshness, and sustainability credentials.
          </p>
